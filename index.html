    <h1>Welkom!</h1>
    <p>Your special time is your power. It makes you strong like a boob. I mean, why would a poptart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? Well then get your shit together. Get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. …and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere ya know? Take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together… Get your shit together. Haha god-damn!</p>
    <p>
        Oh I say good sir, oh harumph, ohh a bope-a-dope-o-bobo. I wish that shotgun was my penis. No jumping in the sewer! Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh no. I'm late to class, bitch. Aaaagh! My ass! MY ASS! It probably has space aids. "And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?"

        You look it up, you don't- you don't even know what it means. Well look where being smart got you. Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before—I'm a pickle! I'm Pickle Ri-i-i-ick! Well then get your shit together. Get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. …and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere ya know? Take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together… Get your shit together.

        That, out there. That's my grave. On one of our adventures Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because in this one the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here a-a-and we buried ourselves and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 2 You’re like Hitler, but even Hitler cared about Germany or something. You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds who refuse to admit they're Christian. They're robots Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're just robots!

        Lick, lickity, lick my balls! Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down. Not MY fault this is happening. Rikitikitavi, bitch!

        Awww, bitch! I know you're real because i have a ton of bad memories with you. Well, to be honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of how everything unfolded. I didn't know how sexual dragons were. I kind of just wanted to do some D&D stuff, y'know? Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry!
